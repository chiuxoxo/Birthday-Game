Landon,
	Thank you, thank you for being an amazing friend,
	A funny goofball, An amazing man of GOD. You are
	all of these things and more, and you will continue
	to be more, I wanted to take the time and put in the
	effort to make a horrible game, for an amazing friend.
	So, thank you, for all you've done and blessed me with.
	I pray that you have an amazing birthday, and an amazing year,
	and many more!
		Much Thanks,
			Your (hopefully) Good Friend,
